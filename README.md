# HCDR-System
Robust Deep Learning CNN model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten characters and digits.
The objective of this project is to identify handwritten characters with the use of neural networks. We have to construct a suitable neural network and train it properly. The program should be able to extract the characters one by one and map the target 
output for training purposes. After the automatic processing of the image, the trainingdataset has to be used to train the “classification engine” for recognition purposes. The program code has to be written in Python and supported with the usage 
of Graphical User Interface (GUI).
